# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator App*

**Tip Calculator App** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Sunny Yu**

Time spent: **2.25** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] A tip slider that adjusts the tip percentage.
* [x] A split slider that adjusts the bill total based on the number of guests in the party
* [x] Default tip: 10%
* [x] Default keyboard: decimal keyboard

## Notes

* Encountered many errors such as _libc++abi: terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException_ that caused me to restart the project
* Unfamiliar with the language Swift so I spent a while learning and looking up syntax
